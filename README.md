# Media Center

This project consisted in the development of a media center with a graphical interface, where users are able to upload songs and videos to share between themselves,
within a local network and across devices.
Basically, a weird scaled-down crossover between Youtube and Spotify. :sweat_smile:

The team started with vague use cases and worked their way up to rigorous diagrams (sequence, class, package) representative of the program's
final behaviour, through the **Visual Paradigm** software, finally setting up a database in **SQL** and implementing the mentioned logic in **JAVA**.

The assignment was developed in **Software Systems Development**, in the first semester of the 3rd and last year of the Bachelor's degree (2019/20).
